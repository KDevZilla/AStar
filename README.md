# How to use it
1. If you look at the picture, you will see that the programme allows you to edit the map/dungeonÂ 
The map consists of five types of cells.


| Cell  | Description                                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Space | You can walk through it.                                 |
| Water | The same as space but it takes 4 steps to walk on water. |
| Wall  | You cannot walk through it.                              |
| Begin | The initial cell.                                        |
| Goal  | The end cell.                                            |


2. Once you've completed configuring the map, simply select AStar Search or Breath First Search.
3. The number shows on each cell is the number of step you need to move from the intial cell to the end cell.
