# How to use it
1. If you look at the picture, you will see that the programme allows you to edit the map/dungeonÂ 
The map consists of five types of cells.


| Cell  | Description                                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Space | You can walk through it.                                 |
| Water | The same as space but it takes 4 steps to walk on water. |
| Wall  | You cannot walk through it.                              |
| Begin | The initial cell.                                        |
| Goal  | The end cell.                                            |


2. Once you've completed configuring the map, simply select AStar Search or Breath First Search.
